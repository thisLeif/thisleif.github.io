# Intent
1. Implement a simple, small quasi-relational-database using Google Sheets via an add-on from a Google Cloud Project. 
1. Use a Google Apps Script mapping layer to simulate SQL statements
1. Database functionality consists of: 
    1. Primary key 
    1. Foreign key
    1. Field constraints
    1. Records:
        1. Add
        2. Update
        3. Delete
        4. Cascade update/delete
1. Present functional capabilities to the end user(s) with an HTML HUD
1. Demonstrate functionality with a use case of a meal planner which accounts for provided food allergies, "Inclusive Meal Planner"

# Out of Scope
1. Indexes
1. Authentication beyond Google Sheets access
1. APIs that are not necessary for the GCP to function adequately for the use case.

# Assumptions
1. The user has write access to the Google Sheet being used.
1. The sample use case will only require what's in-scope in order to be effective and helpful.

## Preconditions
1. A Google Cloud Project is created.
